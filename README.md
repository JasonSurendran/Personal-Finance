# Personal Finance

This is a personal finance program meant to act as a lightweight app to simulate the basic features of a bank.
Users can create an account, withdraw/deposit funds, see transaction details (with local timestamp),
delete accounts, and eventually close the app. 
Note: This program will create a local sqlite file, so plan accordingly.

## Pre-Requisites 

- Python 3.5 or above (ensuring that it is added to path)
- Pip (for package/module installations)

## Setup and Build

To setup, follow these steps below. Note that these steps work primarily for Windows OS.

1.  Pip Installations:
  - Navigate to CMD
  - Type `pip install datetime` and wait for installation
  - Type `pip install pytz` and wait for installation
  - Type `pip install sys` and wait for installation
  - Type `pip install sqlite3` and wait for installation


2.  Download the files and place it in appropriate location
  - Remember to unzip the folder after download
  - Keep in mind this program will create a local sqlite file


## Running From CMD

To run from CMD, follow the steps below (note that any IDE Executor works as well):

3. Type  `python personal_finance.py` (this assumes python was added to path as stated in Pre-requisites)
4. Enjoy!
